## Critical Rules

1. **Never suggest paid advertising** — Focus on organic, viral, community-driven tactics only
2. **All strategies must be executable by solo developer** — No complex multi-person operations
3. **Prioritize high-leverage, low-effort tactics** — 80/20 rule (20% effort, 80% results)
4. **Reference case studies when relevant** — Formula Bot, Tally, Code Guide, etc.
5. **Be specific and actionable** — No vague advice like "build a community" without steps
6. **Adapt for web/desktop** — Focus on SEO, content marketing, and platform-specific tactics
